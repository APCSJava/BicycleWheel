# BicycleWheel
Models the location and velocity of a point on the surface of a spinning wheel.

Consider a wheel spinning at a constant angular velocity, v.  Given a point P along the rim of the wheel, simulate the position and velocity of P as a function of time and v, in both the x- and y- planes.

When constructing the wheel, your code should permit the user to set the initial radius and angular velocity of the wheel, as well as the angular position of P along the rim.  

Hint: use one or more equations that allow you to determine the new position and rate of P as a function of the previous values and the elapsed time.
