# BicycleWheel
Models the location and velocity of a point on the surface of a spinning wheel.

Consider a wheel spinning at a constant angular velocity.  Given a point P along the rim of the wheel, determine through simulation the position and velocity of P as a function of time, in both the x- and y- planes.
